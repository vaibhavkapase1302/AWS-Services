# AWS CloudFormation
* AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to define and manage infrastructure as code. 
* You create a template that describes all the AWS resources that you want¬†and CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring those resources for you.
* It enables you to create and manage AWS resources such as EC2 instances, VPCs, S3 buckets, and more in a predictable and repeatable manner.
* With AWS CloudFormation, you can describe your infrastructure in a template file using JSON or YAML syntax. 
* The template file contains the configuration and properties for the AWS resources you want to create. 
* Once you have defined your template, you can use CloudFormation to create, update, or delete your resources.
* Overall, AWS CloudFormation helps you manage your infrastructure more efficiently and with greater consistency by treating it as code.

## Templates in CloudFormation
* Templates in CloudFormation provide a way to create and manage AWS resources in a repeatable and automated way, allowing for easy deployment and management of complex systems. 
* CloudFormation uses these templates as blueprints for building your AWS resources.

### Components of Template:
* Format Version 
* Description
* Metadata
* Parameters
* Rules
* Mappings
* Conditions
* Transform
* Resources

#### üè∑Ô∏è Parameters: These are user-defined values that can be passed to the template at runtime to customize resource creation.
#### üè∑Ô∏è Resources: These are the AWS resources that are created and configured by the CloudFormation template, such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and DynamoDB tables.
#### üè∑Ô∏è Outputs: These are values that are returned by the CloudFormation stack after it is created, such as the URL of a load balancer or the ID of a newly created EC2 instance.
