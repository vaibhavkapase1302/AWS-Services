# AWS CloudFormation
* AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to define and manage infrastructure as code. 
* It enables you to create and manage AWS resources such as EC2 instances, VPCs, S3 buckets, and more in a predictable and repeatable manner.
* With AWS CloudFormation, you can describe your infrastructure in a template file using JSON or YAML syntax. 
* The template file contains the configuration and properties for the AWS resources you want to create. 
* Once you have defined your template, you can use CloudFormation to create, update, or delete your resources.
* Overall, AWS CloudFormation helps you manage your infrastructure more efficiently and with greater consistency by treating it as code.
